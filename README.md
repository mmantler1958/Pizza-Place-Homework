# Homework and Goals

## Goal: _Mastery of these Skills_

- cloning a GitHub repo
- adding, committing, pushing to GitHub
- naming, with attention to detail
- string & number data types, `typeof`
- template literal use
- `if` comprehension
- loops, modulo
- Markdown Language

## Homework is due to your TA by next Monday before class

<br>

## Set-up your Homework repo on GitHub

1. Use the [Savvy-Homework template repo](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-homework) to _create a new GitHub repo for homework_ - name it something that indicates it is for **Savvy Coders Homework**
2. _Clone the repo_ to your machine

<br>

## Pizza Place Homework

3. Open the new homework directory in VS Code and _create a new JavaScript file_ - name it something that indicates it is homework for **Week 2**
4. Inside your JS file, create two variables: `pizzaPlace` and `numberOfToppings`
5. Have the variables reference the _name of your Pizza Place_ and the _number of toppings_ your Pizza Place offers.
6. _Print the variables and their types_.
7. _Print a template literal_ that uses both variables to construct a short sentence about your Pizza Place.
8. _Construct an `if` statement_ that prints `"Quality, not quantity."` if you offer less than 10 toppings, or `"A whole lot of pizza."` if you offer 10 or more toppings.
9. _Add, commit, and push_ your JS file to your GitHub repo.
10. Send your TA a link to your GitHub Homework repo when finished.

### Bonus Challenge

11. Use a _loop_ to print all of the _even_ numbers from 1 to `numberOfToppings` (or 10)

<br>

An example of the output you want for in this assignment is:

The House of Pizza
string
8 number
At The House of Pizza, we have 8 toppings.
Quality, not quantity.

## Markdown Language Homework

12. Click on the file named README.md in the homework repo you just created.
13. Delete all of the text currently populating the page.
14. This is a Markdown Language file. In it:
    1. Write your name in a large font
    2. Write a subheading about you in a smaller font
    3. Create a list that explains your goals for this course
